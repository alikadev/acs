## Computer-like handmade machine without any micro-processor nor processor

ACS is the gamme of computer that I create at home. It's how I learn electronic so... yeah... Doing this is fun and I don't think that anybody can juge me for this!

ACS machine can be compared to the Z80 or the 6502 but slower and less efficient in any point.

## What computer ACS have done

No one! I started this project not long ago...

## Current project

The current project is the ACS-1 witch use the AI80 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

It's an 8-bit computer with an 8-bit Address-Bus.
